# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-23

- feat: scroll position preservation across mode toggle (prompt-ordinal anchor)
  - Root cause: `setToolsExpanded` on toggle changes transcript height drastically; ScrollView follow-end re-arms once clamped to bottom, so exiting READING almost always snapped to the very bottom
  - Anchor: `{k, d, count}` in the OSC133 prompt-ordinal coordinate system — expansion/collapse never adds/removes prompt boundaries so `k` is invariant; restore = `scrollTo(clamp(base + d), { disableFollow: true })` after layout stabilizes
  - Flow: sync capture at the top of `applyReaderUI` branches → apply UI → `ScrollRestoreMonitor` polls (16ms × ≤20) until generation unchanged + `currentLayout` frame advanced + `contentHeight` stable across two frames, then restores; guards skip when following-end (natural follow takes over)
  - Stability fix: pi-tui renders on demand (zero frames while idle) — the monitor now calls `requestRender` each tick so the two-new-frame criterion is deterministic; without it restores silently timed out
  - Unified clamp model: exact restore when possible, clamp into segment when the anchored block collapsed away, pin to last page when content below is shorter than one viewport (anchored line always stays on screen); no fake blank padding (keeps `[q/{}/search` line coordinates clean)
- feat: `autoExpandTools` config (`false` disables auto expand/collapse of tool output on toggle)
  - Default `true` (previous behavior); `false` keeps tool output state untouched — position is then naturally lossless; anchor runs anyway as an idempotent no-op
  - Config resolved from the package dir first, user-level fallback kept
- feat: `app.tools.expand` now works inside READING mode
  - Resolves the user keybinding via `kb.matches`/`kb.getKeys` (factory third arg); toggling goes through the same anchor wrapper so manual expand/collapse also preserves position
  - Priority fixed: SEARCH_INPUT > toggle > exit > help > expand > semantic nav > scrolling; keys bound to pre-empted actions (`?`, esc, i, ctrl+c) stay unreachable by design
  - `?` help dynamically lists the effective expand key(s) with edit/reading attribution
- fix: package `config.json` was never read at runtime
  - jiti compiles extensions into base64 `data:` URL modules where `import.meta.url` carries no file path, so module-dir resolution silently fell back to the user-level config; now uses the CJS wrapper-injected `__dirname` (probes both `<pkg>/src/..` and `<pkg>/src`) before falling back
- test: +12 unit tests (anchor capture/restore round-trip, d clamping, followingEnd skip, count-mismatch abort, generation invalidation, monitor stability, config default fallback)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-21

- feat: semantic navigation + anchored scrolling + search state machine
  - Navigation: `[q/]q` prev/next question (OSC133;A prompt), `[a/]a` prev/next answer (first non-empty after prompt), `[t/]t` prev/next tool (heuristic `▌/⎿/●` etc.), `{`/`}` prev/next paragraph (blank-line / `─/—/—/━` separator / `OSC133` zone), `/` search (self-contained: no TUI overlay), `n`/`N` next/prev match
  - Search state machine: `READING --/--> INPUT --enter--> NAV` — `INPUT` captures all keys (incl. `j/k/n`) until `enter` commits to `NAV`, `NAV` only accepts `?` shortcuts, `esc` closes search/cancels highlight staying in `READING` or exits `READING` when no search; single bottom `Search:` bar via `ReadonlyEditor` (native top-right overlay hidden, persists until `esc`, no throttle); robust `isEnterKey/isEscKey` (`\r`/`\n`, Kitty `\x1b[13u`/`\x1b[27u`)
  - Config: remove 2s `TOGGLE_CACHE_TTL` — persistent cache re-read on session_start/reload; default `toggleKey` now `ctrl+o`
  - Navigation: `[q/]q` prev/next question (OSC133;A prompt), `[a/]a` prev/next answer (first non-empty after prompt), `[t/]t` prev/next tool (heuristic `▌/⎿/●` etc.), `{`/`}` prev/next paragraph (blank-line / `─/—/—/━` separator / `OSC133` zone), `/` search (self-contained: no TUI overlay), `n`/`N` next/prev match
  - Anchoring: `questionAnchor` config (`pinTop`=1 default, `third`=floor(vh/3), `center`=floor(vh/2) or number), `visibleBehavior` (`keep` default keeps viewport when target already visible with flash, `reanchor` forces re-anchor), `wrapNavigation` optional; computes `row - offset` clamped to `maxTop` with `disableFollow:true`
  - Count prefix: `1-9` accumulates, `0` only after existing buffer, `800ms` timeout, `5j` / `3]q` / `2}` etc. for line/half/page/paragraph/semantic jumps
  - Paragraph `{`/`}`: `isParagraphBoundary` treats `─/—/—/━` and `OSC133` as boundaries, supports consecutive blanks; force reanchor so holding `}` always advances; `from` anchors to `lastSemanticRow` (5s) for continuous motion
  - Search `/`/`n`/`N`: extension-owned input mode — `/` enters search-typing state where every printable key (incl. `j/k/n`) appends to the query with live `flash` echo and match count/auto-jump (no `TuiAltScreen` overlay, so focus/`Enter` conflicts are impossible); `Backspace` edits, `Enter` commits (read mode `n`/`N` now navigate), `Esc` cancels; `n`/`N` cycle through matches with anchored scroll + flash `Search "pin" 2/20`
  - Reliability: `factory` syncs `latestTui` and `inputListener` uses `curTui = latestTui ?? tt` for `scrollBy/scrollTo`, `getViewportState` traverses `frame.root` to find `scrollContentLines` (fix `No content` for `[q`), `prev` at `maxTop` includes visible last prompt, `next` uses `lastSemanticRow` for continuous `]q` stepping; shared `BracketSequence` (500ms) + `CountBuffer` (800ms) + dedup guard (30ms terminal→input) for dual `inputListener` + `onTerminalInput` channels; try/catch viewport fallback for `regular` mode; flash feedback `Question 2/5` / `No more questions` / `Tool` / `Answer`
  - Help: `?` overlay is a centered bordered box (`╭─╮`) with aligned key/description columns (no truncation, `Esc` to close)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-20

- feat: first usable release — Vim-style reading mode (fullscreen)
  - Toggle: `alt+o` (`config.json: toggleKey` configurable) via dual `TUI inputListener` + `onTerminalInput` to enter/exit `READING`, `/reader`/`/scroll` fallback; exit via `esc/i/ctrl+c`, `?` English help closed with `Esc`
  - Scrolling: `ctrl+u/d` half page (`half=floor(vh/2)`), `ctrl+f/b` full page (`page=vh-1`, `OVERLAP=1`) matching `TuiAltScreen`; `j/k`, `ctrl+n/p` line-wise; `g g` (300ms, including batched `gg`) to top, `G` to bottom
  - Read-only: `READING` swallows printable/single-byte keys, mouse wheel passes through; input bar uses `ReadonlyEditor` with left-aligned `◉ Reading` (borderless) overlay, original input preserved and restored on exit; tool outputs expand/collapse asynchronously via `Promise` without blocking first frame
  - Reliability: `listenerInstalled` prevents duplicate install; `currentCtx` refreshed on all `session_*`; `latestTui` stale guard; `gg` 300ms window
  - Compatibility: legacy control sequences and Kitty protocol (`\u001b[111;3u` etc.), `viewportHeight` falls back to `getPrimaryScrollView ?? 20`
